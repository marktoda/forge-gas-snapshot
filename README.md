# Forge Gas Snapshot

Flexible, checked-in gas snapshotting for [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs).

Forge has native gas reporting with `forge snapshot` and `forge test --gas-report`, but neither perfectly fit my needs. Specifically, `forge-gas-snapshot` aims to allow for:
- Gas reports over specific, known flows
    - not entire tests and not an average of all calls
- Check gas diffs into version control
- See gas changes over time through commit history

# Installation
```solidity
soldeer install forge-gas-snapshot~v0.0.4
```

- NOTE: foundry.toml must be updated to allow forge to write the snapshots
```toml
[profile.default]
...
ffi = true
fs_permissions = [{ access = "read-write", path = ".forge-snapshots/"}]
```

# Usage

By default, gas snapshots are automatically written to `./forge-snapshots/<test-name>.snap` on run.

## Snapshot modes

### Wrap
Wrap arbitrary code in `snapStart(testName)` and `snapEnd` to snapshot gas usage.

```solidity
import {GasSnapshot} from "forge-gas-snapshot/GasSnapshot.sol";

contract MyTest is GasSnapshot {
    function test() public {
        snapStart("test name");
        // do stuff
        snapEnd();
    }
}
```

### Closure
Snapshot a zero-parameter function pointer with `snap`

```solidity
import {GasSnapshot} from "forge-gas-snapshot/GasSnapshot.sol";

contract MyTest is GasSnapshot {
    function doStuff() internal {
        // do stuff
    }

    function test() public {
        snap("test name", doStuff);
    }
}
```

### Arbitrary values
Snapshot arbitrary values with `snap`

```solidity
import {GasSnapshot} from "forge-gas-snapshot/GasSnapshot.sol";

contract MyTest is GasSnapshot {
    function test() public {
        uint256 value = getValue()
        snap("test name", value);
    }
}
```

### Contract Size
Snapshot contract size with `snapSize`

```solidity
import {GasSnapshot} from "forge-gas-snapshot/GasSnapshot.sol";

contract MyTest is GasSnapshot {
    function test() public {
        address addr = new Contract();
        snapSize("test name", addr);
    }
}
```

### Check Mode
Snapshots can be run in check-mode where they revert on mismatch by setting an environment variable `FORGE_SNAPSHOT_CHECK=true`


# TODO Improvements

- [ ] Introspection for file / function name
- [ ] Group related snapshots in a single file
- [ ] Check overhead and accuracy
- [ ] Env config for snap dir
